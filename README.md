## Exploratory Data Analysis \(EDA\)

To measure the performance of the Machine Learning model, we use precision, recall and accuracy (f-score).

The precision of a model describes how many detected items are truly relevant. It is calculated by dividing the true positives by overall positives.

Recall is a measure of how many relevant elements were detected. Therefore it divides true positives by the number of relevant elements.

The F-score is a measure of a test's accuracy. It is calculated from recall and precision values.
